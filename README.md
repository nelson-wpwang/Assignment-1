We chose Httpstat in Python as our homework. 
This is a modification work that modify the original code from coder Xiao Meng from https://github.com/reorx/httpstat.

Major modifications we made:
1. Template change to let it look more fancy.
2. Color change in the output.
3. Add in an function that calculates the percentage each part took in the connection.
4. Add in a sentence to show whether the website is based on http or a more secured https.

Some thoughts:
Me and my teammates are really thankful for Prof.Alshaykh for providing us this hand-on project, we are both beginners for coding and we only have very basic knowledge of what coding can do, in this homework, although we spent a lot of time understanding the code, we still get excited that we understand how a product works from the original code. This work has inspired us to learn more enthusiastic and more optimistic in furture studies. 

The display after our modification is shown below:
